## Part B: ALU and ROM Embedded System
This repository contains a collection of VHDL modules and related files showcasing various digital design elements. Each file is a building block for larger hardware designs, focusing on arithmetic logic, memory, simulation, and hardware-specific constraints for FPGA platforms. Codes include design files, simulation files, a modified IP diagram wrapper file, and finally a hardware constraint file
This project was tested with a Zybo Z7-10 Digilent development board
